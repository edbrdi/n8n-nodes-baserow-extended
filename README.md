# n8n-nodes-baserow-extended

I extended the initial node with the ability to use the database/table/field name instead of ID (when dynamically filled).
The changes have been submitted to the original repository, but I'm not sure when they will be merged. Since I need the changes in my project and probably add more changes later, I created this repository.
